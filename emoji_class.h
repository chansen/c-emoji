/* Emoji sequence classification.
 *
 * emoji_sequence_type_t identifies the structural type of an sequence:
 *   BASIC    - a single emoji codepoint with an optional variation selector.
 *   KEYCAP   - a digit, # or * followed by an optional VS and U+20E3.
 *   FLAG     - a pair of regional indicator letters (e.g. 🇺🇸).
 *   TAG      - a base emoji followed by tag characters and a cancel tag
 *              (e.g. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿).
 *   MODIFIER - a modifier base followed by a Fitzpatrick skin tone modifier.
 *   ZWJ      - two or more emoji joined by U+200D zero width joiners.
 *
 * emoji_presentation_style_t indicates how the sequence should be rendered:
 *   DEFAULT  - no variation selector present; consult emoji_ucd_is_presentation()
 *              to determine whether the codepoint is emoji or text by default.
 *   TEXT     - VS-15 (U+FE0E) was present; render as text.
 *   EMOJI    - VS-16 (U+FE0F) was present; render as emoji.
