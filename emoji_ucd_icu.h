/* ICU4C-backed implementation of the emoji_ucd.h Unicode Character Database
 * predicates, used when EMOJI_UCD_USE_ICU is defined before the first
 * include of emoji_ucd.h. See emoji_ucd_builtin.h for the default,
 * dependency-free implementation.
 *
 * emoji_ucd_is_emoji(), emoji_ucd_is_modifier_base(), and
 * emoji_ucd_is_presentation() delegate to ICU4C's u_hasBinaryProperty()
 * for the Emoji, Emoji_Modifier_Base, and Emoji_Presentation properties
 * respectively, instead of consulting a bundled trie.
 *
 * Requires linking against ICU4C's common library, e.g.:
 *   cc ... $(pkg-config --cflags --libs icu-uc)
 *
 * CAUTION — Unicode version skew: results reflect the Unicode Character
 * Database bundled with whichever ICU4C is linked, not the Unicode version
 * this project targets and ships under unicode-data/. Call
 * u_getUnicodeVersion() (declared right in <unicode/uchar.h>) to check the
 * linked version. A linked ICU4C older than the UCD version a given
 * codepoint was assigned in will disagree with emoji_ucd_builtin.h, and
 * with this project's own emoji-data.txt-based conformance tests, on that
 * codepoint.
 *
 * Do not include this header directly — include emoji_ucd.h, which selects
 * between this and emoji_ucd_builtin.h.
